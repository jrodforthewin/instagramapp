Some time ago I got a very nice Email, in which my fonts were praised. I always like getting
such emails ;-). The sender of the email asked me, whether I have a frogletterbat, as her 
nickname was Frogii. Searching my archive, I recognized, that there was only one font with a
very abstract froghead. All those cat-, cog-, and animalfonts, but no real frogfont! This 
had to be changed! Here is part one. 
The name of the font means translated good weather, bad weather. I do not know, whether you 
have this in UK/US, too. Here in Germany it is told, the higher the frogs climb, the better 
the weather. 
Enjoy!
